          <p>"Body and Soul" is a popular song and jazz standard written in 1930 with lyrics by Edward Heyman, Robert Sour and
            Frank Eyton; and music by Johnny Green.</p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>"Body and Soul" was written in New York City for the British actress and singer Gertrude Lawrence, who introduced
            it to London audiences. Published in England, it was first performed in the United States by Libby Holman in
            the 1930 Broadway revue Three's a Crowd. In Britain, the orchestras of Jack Hylton and Ambrose recorded the ballad
            first in the same week in February 1930. In the United States, the tune grew quickly in popularity, and by the
            end of 1930 at least 11 American bands had recorded it. Louis Armstrong was the first jazz musician to record
            "Body and Soul", in October 1930, but it was Paul Whiteman and Jack Fulton who popularized it in United States.</p>
          <p>"Body and Soul" remains a jazz standard, with hundreds of versions performed and recorded by dozens of artists.
            Classic vocal recordings include those of Ella Fitzgerald, Annette Hanshaw, Billie Holiday, Billy Eckstine, Etta
            James, Sarah Vaughan (for the 1957 album Swingin' Easy and the 1978 album How Long Has This Been Going On?) and
            Frank Sinatra, and such musicians as Benny Goodman, Lee Konitz, Bill Evans, Russell Garcia (on his 1958 album
            The Johnny Ever Greens, starring John Williams on piano and Don Fagerquist on trumpet), John Coltrane, (on his
            1964 album, Coltrane's Sound,) Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Stan Kenton, Royce Campbell, Steve Rochinski,
            Lester Young and Gerry Mulligan contributed notable instrumental recordings. The Manhattan Transfer sang it on
            their album Extensions in 1979, with lyrics honoring both Hawkins and Eddie Jefferson. Guitar legend Wes Montgomery
            recorded it four times. To this day, "Body and Soul" is the most recorded jazz standard. (This is one of the
            few big hits that had a number of different versions of the lyric.)</p>
          <h3>Coleman Hawkins version of "Body and Soul"</h3>
          <p>One of the most famous and influential takes of Body and Soul was recorded by Coleman Hawkins and His Orchestra
            on October 11, 1939, at their only recording session for Bluebird, a subsidiary of RCA Victor. The recording
            is unusual in that the song's melody is only hinted at in the recording; Hawkins' two-choruses of improvisation
            over the tune's chord progression constitute almost the entire take. Because of this, as well as the imaginative
            use of harmony and break from traditional swing cliches, the recording is recognised as part of the "early tremors
            of bebop". In 2004, the Library of Congress entered it into the National Recording Registry.</p>
